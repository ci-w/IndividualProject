## FINAL v1 v2 (copy)
**Makerspaces**: workshops that are accessible to the public which allows for a sharing of both tools and knowledge. 


## Making & Makerspaces Notes ?
What points do I want to make here......
- Ive probably explained what making is before this point. 
- talk about its benefits: i.e. learning with physical objects, 

what are makerspaces: locations that combine tools/resources and other people. Have lots of different forms (hackerlabs, fablabs, community workshops). Around [number] in the UK, and steadily growing. 

their benefits: (talk about what other papers have found)

How they are inaccessible: 
(this should be a big section bc its what my project is about, no?)
There is alot about makerspaces that WILL include making, just need to be sure that I cover all the points about making that i want to. 
- the "general" problem of makerspaces ideology being inclusive but in practice struggling to incorporate new groups 
    - how other people have tried to fix this 

Tangible barriers:
- makerspace locations not being physically accessible (i.e. stairs to workshop)
- actual makerspace workshops not being physically accessible (no space for wheelchairs to move, machines/desks at wrong height, )
- making equipment not being able to be used by people with motor impairments etc i.e. small buttons requiring high manual dexterity

Intangible barriers:
- people with knowledge of making not having knowledge of how to work with people with disabilities, and vice versa (knowledge gap ?)
- how to portray tutorials/instructions in a way thats helpful to disabled people
- how to portray tutorials/instructions in a way that actually uses the tools/equipment correctly idk the words 

### Stuff from papers
"Making Community (26)" found that makerspaces, as well as playing a role in innovation and peer learning, function as spaces to support wellbeing, exist as a social space, serve the needs of their communities, and reach out to excluded groups. 
"Give access to tools including digital fabrication and open electronics"
"lowers barriers to entry, enabling more people to create their own solutions to problems or even bring products to market" (innovation)
Notes that access to the benefits of makerspaces is unevenly spread. Many makerspace users are affulent males, with backgrounds in tech/creative.

## Designing with disabled people 
How to design something for disabled people so that they can use it without issue. 
There is a lot of different opinions on how to approach and carry this out. 
Discuss these different approaches, compare them, and say why what I'M doing.
Most of these methods touch on disability theory i.e. how should we think and talk about disability.
