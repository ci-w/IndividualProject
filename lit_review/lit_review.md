## FINAL v1 v2 (copy)
**Makerspaces**: workshops that are accessible to the public which allow for a sharing of tools and knowledge. 


## Making & Makerspaces Notes ?
What points do I want to make here......
- Ive probably explained what making is before this point. 
- talk about its benefits: i.e. learning with physical objects, 

what are makerspaces: locations that combine tools/resources and other people. Have lots of different forms (hackerlabs, fablabs, community workshops). Around [number] in the UK, and steadily growing. 

their benefits: (talk about what other papers have found)

How they are inaccessible: 
(this should be a big section bc its what my project is about, no?)
There is alot about makerspaces that WILL include making, just need to be sure that I cover all the points about making that i want to. 
- the "general" problem of makerspaces ideology being inclusive but in practice struggling to incorporate new groups 
    - how other people have tried to fix this 

Tangible barriers:
- makerspace locations not being physically accessible (i.e. stairs to workshop)
- actual makerspace workshops not being physically accessible (no space for wheelchairs to move, machines/desks at wrong height, )
- making equipment not being able to be used by people with motor impairments etc i.e. small buttons requiring high manual dexterity

Intangible barriers:
- people with knowledge of making not having knowledge of how to work with people with disabilities, and vice versa (knowledge gap ?)
- how to portray tutorials/instructions in a way thats helpful to disabled people
- how to portray tutorials/instructions in a way that actually uses the tools/equipment correctly idk the words 

### Stuff from papers
"Making Community (26)" found that makerspaces, as well as playing a role in innovation and peer learning, function as spaces to support wellbeing, exist as a social space, serve the needs of their communities, and reach out to excluded groups. 
"Give access to tools including digital fabrication and open electronics"
"lowers barriers to entry, enabling more people to create their own solutions to problems or even bring products to market" (innovation)
Notes that access to the benefits of makerspaces is unevenly spread. Many makerspace users are affluent males, with backgrounds in tech/creative.

## Designing with disabled people 
How to design something for disabled people so that they can use it without issue. 
There is a lot of different opinions on how to approach and carry this out. 
Discuss these different approaches, compare them, and say why what I'M doing.
Most of these methods touch on disability theory i.e. how should we think and talk about disability. 

**Universal design**: "The design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design"
- Equitable Use: The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities. Flexiability in Use: The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.
- Simple and Intuitive Use: Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user’s experience, knowledge, language skills or current concentration level.  
- Perceptible Information: The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user’s sensory abilities.
- Tolerance for Error: The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions. 
- Low Physical Effort: The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue. 
- Size and Space for Approach and Use: Appropriate size and space are provided for approach, reach, manipulation and use regardless of the user’s body size, posture or mobility. 

**Inclusive design**: Inclusive design bears similarities to universal design and design for all, but with the requirement to also include the concept of ‘‘reasonable’’ in the definition.

**Accessible design**: ‘design focused on principles of extending standard design to persons with some type of performance limitation to maximize the number of potential customers who can readily use a product, building or service, which may be achieved by 
• designing products, services and environments that are readily usable by most users without any modification, 
• making products or services adaptable to different users (adapting user interfaces) and 
• having standardized interfaces to be compatible with special products for persons with disabilities’’

**Universal access**: ‘‘conscious and systematic effort to proactively apply principles, methods, and tools of universal design, in order to develop information society technologies that are accessible and usable by all citizens, including the very young and the elderly, as well as people with different types of disabilities, thus avoiding the need for a posteriori adaptations or specialized design’’

**Cooperative/participatory design**: is a design process involving much more than just the active involvement of users in the process. It entails full cooperation between the users and the development team, who share their respective knowledge and experiences by designing together.

All kinda merging together babeeeey. 
Main points: design things so that many people can use them without modification. Doing this requires understanding how different types of people use whatever you're designing. 

**Ability-based design**: builds from the above. Makes the point that unlike alot of the real world constraints these other techniques have come from (i.e. retrofitting a wheelchair ramp to a door), software is more easily changeable and automated. 
Continuing the idea of removing the burden of adapting from the user, and instead adapting the software to their needs. and having this adaptation-system BUILT IN. 
It had a bunch of points to follow too. Compare and constrast with the points made above, and pull out which ones apply to me :) 

1. Ability. Designers will focus on ability not dis-ability, striving to leverage all that users can do. Required
2. Accountability. Designers will respond to poor performance by changing systems, not users, leaving users as they are. Required  
3. Adaptation. Interfaces may be self-adaptive or user-adaptable to provide the best possible match to users’ abilities. Recommended 
4. Transparency. Interfaces may give users awareness of adaptations and the means to inspect, override, discard, revert, store, retrieve, preview, and test those adaptations. Recommended  
5. Performance. Systems may regard users’ performance, and may monitor, measure, model, or predict that performance. Recommended  
6. Context. Systems may proactively sense context and anticipate its effects on users’ abilities. Recommended  
7. Commodity. Systems may comprise low-cost, inexpensive, readily available commodity hardware and software. Encouraged
