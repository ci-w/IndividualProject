# Literature Review 

## Topics ? Points ?
- gather information on how to design something for people with IDs 
- different making technologies 
- can apply things that have been learnt in making physical makerspaces accessible to my online "makerspace"

## Notes 
<p>Makerspaces == hackerspaces == fab labs. Aim to enable people to access resources like digital fabrication and open electronics. Also can include traditional crafts. <br>
Dissertation: Building from research done surrounding these groups of disabled people benefiting from making, as well as the barriers for their entry in traditional makerspaces, creating a resource that can be used as a tool for them to carry out making projects. <br>
With regards to DIY-AT, having more of a focus on disabled people themselves creating their own DIY-AT. 
“Nothing for us without us” <br>
Human centred design: close engagement of users throughout the design process. <br>
Universal design: making a design usable by the widest group of people with respect to ability and other characteristics. </p>
