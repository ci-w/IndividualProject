# Literature Review 

## Topics ? Points ?
- gather information on how to design something for people with IDs 
- different making technologies 
- can apply things that have been learnt in making physical makerspaces accessible to my online "makerspace"

## Notes 
<p>Makerspaces == hackerspaces == fab labs. Aim to enable people to access resources like digital fabrication and open electronics. Also can include traditional crafts. <br>
Dissertation: Building from research done surrounding these groups of disabled people benefiting from making, as well as the barriers for their entry in traditional makerspaces, creating a resource that can be used as a tool for them to carry out making projects. <br>
With regards to DIY-AT, having more of a focus on disabled people themselves creating their own DIY-AT. 
“Nothing for us without us” <br>
Human centred design: close engagement of users throughout the design process. Same as user centered design?<br>
Universal design: making a design usable by the widest group of people with respect to ability and other characteristics. <br>
UX = user experience
IDC = Interaction Design and Children
PDP = Participatory development process
DIE = digitalised innovation environments 
K-12 = kindergarten to 12th grade (17/18yrs) 
critical disability studies = a political, historical and academic lense used to consider the barriers that hinder people with disabilities from participating (in the maker movement)
I should be thinking about plain language and technical writing.
Issues
- identify the abilities of the user 
- adapt the interface to reflect these
- allow user to see what adaptions have been made, and change them 
- constantly evolve with the user </p>
