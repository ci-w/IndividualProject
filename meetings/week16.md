# Week 16 Meeting Minutes - 2/2/2023
## Project
* Brought updated system diagram to discuss. Supervisor agreed that it looked better than before, especially the removal of requirements into separate components and separation between the user and user profile.
* Decided that it was fine that non-logged in users cant create a syllabus.
* Supervisor brought up the idea that being able to have multiple user profiles per user would be good, for situations where it's an instructor/carer working with a group of people. The new system design allows for this, and it will be added.
* Point of having the language surrounding disability be consistent, including within the codebase.
* Supervisor suggested idea of displaying difficulty of project for the user. E.g. if the user and project's requirements are equal, the difficulty would be 100%. Will keep this in mind.
* Similarly, having a "practice" button/feature that allows the user to do more projects at the same level.
* The same project having multiple difficulty levels (i.e. adapting one project and each adaptation having different requirements). Would allow for more flexibility in syllabus creation. May be difficult in respect to the actual projects. 
* Supervisor brought up that the syllabus path/creation did not have to be linear - many ways of learning. E.g. having multiple projects at the same level.
* Write up the system refactor/redesign. Write from post-perspective.

For next week: implement system redesign, everything apart from syllabus creation feature. Week after that, have the syllabus feature done.
