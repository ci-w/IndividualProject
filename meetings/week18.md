# Week 18 Meeting Minutes - 17/2/2023
Showed progress so far, agreed that I just had to keep working on it. Slightly behind in what I wanted to have done by this point. This was due to myself not realising how long this work would take. 
Agreed to set a strict deadline for next week in order to keep on schedule. 

For next week: send hosted website before meeting, aim to complete website. 
### Next meeting: Friday 24th Feb, 12:00 in-person
