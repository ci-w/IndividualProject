# Week 15 Meeting Minutes - 27/1/2023
## Project
* Discussed current implementation level
* Decided to continue mainly focusing on implementation right now
* Supervisor brought up making the implementation more modular: to separate out modules and define how they need to interact
* This is a good idea, as the project has evolved since I first designed/started it and thus isn't as modular as it could be
* Also design the search function (which the syllabus implementation uses) more clearly, with the ability to handle and relax constraints if they cannot be fulfilled 

## Plan
* For next week: bring a redesigned system diagram/final system plan
* For the next 2 weeks: spend 2 weeks coding, end with working prototype 
* Aim to not be thinking about code by March

### Next meeting: Thursday 2nd Feb 12:00 in-person
