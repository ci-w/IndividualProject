# Week 5 Meeting Minutes - 20/10/2022
## Ethics
Discussed the confusing email I got back from ethics advisor, supervisor suggested it may have been sent to the wrong person. Told to explain this and ask again about the timeframe. From my discussions with other students, another supervisor had said at least 8 weeks. Decided this would be too long to do at the start of the project and so to have it something to consider doing nearer the end, in semester 2 for an evaluation. 
Instead this semester to talk with people from the organisations I could include without additional ethics approval. Need to organise the related forms and paperwork for next week. 

## Website / Meetings
Website took longer to build than expected, so not ready to start meetings this week. For next week will have a website I can use as a talking point when meeting with organisations. 

Start organising meetings, with the idea to have 2-3 meetings reiterating over the website's design. Agreed to send supervisor the emails I plan to send out, and have a meeting to discuss the script and plans with him before I have any external meetings. 

Suggested I look at tapeblocks.com and study it to see what's useful and what could potentially be improved in my project. 

Invited to a zoom meeting with supervisor and Dr Kirsten Ellis to discuss my project and ask questions about her work etc. 8am 4th November for about 30 minutes. 

## To do
* Get a "complete" website I can use for meetings for next week
* Sort out standard ethics paperwork
* Reply to ethics advice email

Next meeting: Wednesday 26th Oct 2.45pm (Supervisor cancelled)
