# Week 3 Meeting Minutes - 6/10/2022
Discussed what the project was actually about: a library of 'maker' project idea's that can be adapted to an individuals specific needs.

Suggestion of researching existing online databases of making projects such as: thingiverse, rs online, makezine. Looking into what's already out there and how these current implementations may not be accessible. 

Then went into detail on specific aspects:

The concept of a curriculum/syllabus for a user. Allowing them to select what type of "big"/complex end project they want to complete, and then designing a path of projects which let them gain the skills needed to complete this. 

Having the same project be adaptable so that users with different access requirements can complete it. I.e. having steps be carried out in a different way. Idea of the final way being someone else helping the user as you want to promote independence. 

This is connected to how to handle the user specifying their ability/access needs for projects in an accurate and inoffensive way. This would be used to tailor the syllabus/steps in projects. Perhaps as a test of their skills.

Concept of "gamifying" the acquisition of skills. For example, tokens (like a certificate for completing a project) that are created using the technology utilised in the project. A small lapel pin made by a 3D printer, or for an electronics project, one that lights up. 

Then the projects themselves:

Agreed the majority of the projects on the sites would be taken from other libraries, under Creative Commons licence. May need to adapt these to make them accessible.

Do research into understanding factors that make people struggle while making, and how to motivate them. 

Have a couple of "exemplar" projects which I carry out myself to get a better understanding and create an in depth tutorial of. Carry out reflection and analysis on these. 

Idea of having projects that are making guides for items that would help users with a specific disability in other projects. 

Types of project may include: tapeblocks, 3D printer, Arduinos (which are simplified little electronic circuits), and Raspberry Pi. 

Making tools to help people navigate the site. 

Talk to:

Local maker spaces: on how their own spaces are and aren't accessible.

Intellectual disability & brain injury services/charities for their ideas.

Online project makers on how to make their own projects accessible.
Want support from these communities and engagement from them at the start and end. 

**Plan** 

Months time

- Engagement with groups listed above

Weeks time
- Read through papers and collate highlights/general trends 
- Look into the ethics
- List of potential organisations to contact
