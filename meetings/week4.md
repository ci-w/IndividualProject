# Week 4 Meeting Minutes - 13/10/2022
Ethics
* Discussed the issue of getting ethics approval for interviewing the potential users for the project i.e. people with intellectual disabilities and brain injuries. University policy states that if "participants have an impairment that may limit their understanding or communication" the student needs to apply to the School Ethics Committee for ethics approval. Additionally it states "More unusual projects (e.g. participants under the age of 16, or with an impairment) will require that your supervisor make a full ethics application to the College Ethics Committee." Needs further investigation on my part to find out if the timescale for this would be suitable for my project.

Organisations
* I came to the meeting with a list of potential organisations to contact. Supervisor agreed that these all seemed suitable to contact later. 

Papers
* Discussed papers I'd read during the past week and what parts of them where applicable to my project. Such as: importance of expertise of coaches in such making project and allowing students to have the time to problem solve on their own. 

Projects
* Had list of examples of potential projects and curriculums but agreed that it'd be a better idea to create a functioning website and then come back to the specifics of the projects. Discussed the idea of having multiple options of projects to satisfy requirements of a curriculum. 

Website
* Had questions over specifics of the website. Put forward the idea of having an account system that recorded the users access requirements, current skillset, curriculum and project progress. Supervisor agreed that this would be a good idea, and that I should use lightweight already available code & plugins for this. He suggested that project guides should be of a simple form and able to be embedded so that people can pull them to their own sites. 

Framing
* Discussed the issue of what assumption(s) to make over what environment the projects are being carried out in. Need to do research into different environments and their differences. Such as a traditional makerspace, a specialist disability centre, if a coach is present and what their skillset is (disability, technical, or researcher focused), or if a carer is present and learning alongside the user. 

Plan for next week
* Create a website prototype which shows what the site will be like, to be used to show the organisations
* Investigate ethics approval timescale

Next meeting: Thursday 20th October 12:00
