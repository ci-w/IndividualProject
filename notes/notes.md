### Issue of framing
Assumption about where these projects are to be carried out. Many areas:
* specialised disability group with coaches
* traditional makerspace

and this then goes to who is present: disability coach, a technical expert, a carer learning alongside them, researcher-led? All of these require different framing of instructions/projects etc. Potentially able to cover a few areas but need to research into how these differ. Supervisor said to go for researcher-led.

there seems to be more "hackerspaces", would these be applicable?
