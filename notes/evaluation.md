# Evaluation
* Adjust order of questions based on who I'm talking to: do what they're more comfortable with first 
## Pre-questionnaire
(getting an idea of who this person is and establishing a baseline) Most of these questions would be on a scale of 1-5 or similar. For the people from disability organisations, "you" refers more to the disabled people.
• Do you think this tool would be useful?
• Would you use this tool (i.e. in your makerspace/work)?
• If you haven’t got any experience in Making, is that something you are wanting to try?
• Do you think this tool will lower the barriers to entry?

These questions are to gauge your gut reaction and first impressions. It's ok if you don't have an answer for them. Please give both the good and bad. 
Makerspaces:
* What is your experience with Making?
    - will likely include makerspaces, but prompt if needed
    - length of time
    - how did they get introduced to it
* What is your definition of Making? (iffy)
* Do you use websites to get project tutorials/ideas?
    - If so, which one(s) and what's your opinions on them

Disability orgs:
* What's your experience in working with people with disabilities?
    - obviously a topic people may want to speak less about
    - just wanting to get a general idea of your background
    - for specific disabilities (IDs, cognitive impairments, other)
(Re-explain what Making is)
* Do you have any experience in this?
    - at all, or activities like this with disabled people 
* If you don't, is this something you'd be interested in (for the people you work with)

## "Demo"
• Have a tour of the site
    - This could potentially be a video 
• Let them have a little play around with it
• Have a list of tasks for them to do
    Consider a potential user for this site. With them in mind, try to:
    - create an account
    - create a profile 
    - view a project
    - add a tool to your profile
    - change your profile
    - find a project that would be a good end goal, and then create a syllabus with it  


## Main questions
Makerspaces:
• 



• Would this tool lower the barriers to entry? I.e. does it make it easier for disabled people to do Making projects
    – have a question for each barrier
• Does it show tutorials in an accessible way?
    – Specify further i.e. "readability/information easy to understand/"
• Does it allow a user to improve their skills over a customised course of projects?
    – Do you think doing these projects would improve their skills
• Can you identify accessibility issues with how these projects are presented? 
• Which parts of the tool are the most useful?
