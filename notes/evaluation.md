# Evaluation Design 
Adjust order of questions based on who I’m talking to: do what they’re more comfortable with first. Adjust language depending on the person.

## Pre-Study Interview 
Getting an idea of who this person is and establishing a baseline. For getting gut reaction/first impression - explain this to them, as well as wanting good and bad. For the people from disability organisations, "you" refers more to the disabled people.
* What is your experience in:
    - Making/makerspaces:
        - Length of time
        - How did you get introduced to it
        - What is your understanding of Making
        - Do you use online resources to get your making project tutorials/ideas
            - If so, which ones and what's your opinion on them
        - How did you learn the skills you use when Making
    - Working with people that have disabilities:
* Would you be interested in using this tool (in your makerspace/disability organisation)?
* If you haven't got any experience with Making, is it something you are wanting to try?

## Study / Demonstration 
* Have a tour of site, potentially a short video
* Let them explore the site
* Have a list of tasks for them to do:
    - "Consider a potential user for this site. With them in mind, try to:
        - Register an account
        - Create a profile
        - View a project
        - Add a tool to your profile
        - Update your profile
        - Find a project that would be a suitable end goal, and create a syllabus for it 

## Post Study Interview 
* Do you think this tool would make it easier for disabled people to do Making projects
    - Reference specific barriers 
* Does it show tutorials in an accessible way?
    - In terms of readability, ease of understanding, page design
* Do you think following a syllabus would improve a persons skills 
* Can you identify any accessibility issues with how these projects are presented? With the site as a whole?
* Which part of the site is the most useful?
