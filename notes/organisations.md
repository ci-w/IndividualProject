## Organisations
Discussion of potential organisations to engage with, why certain ones are more/less suitable etc. 
Just really need 1 organisation of each to talk to.

What is a maker space: 
"A makerspace is a physical location where people gather to co-create, share resources and knowledge, work on projects, network, and build. "
They can also be called hackerspace.
Maker spaces: (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/libraries-and-makerspaces/libraries-and-makerspaces) 

Glasgow uni handprints e-nable. Less applicable, but 3D prints hand/arm prosthetics https://www.glasgowunisrc.org/organisation/handprintenable/

Maybe at libraries? But cannot find any definitive clubs. (https://scottishlibraries.org/projects/past-projects/3d-printing/)

ID & brain injury organisations:
https://www.fair-deal.org/ - learning disability "social enterprise company" in castlemilk
https://gda.scot/ - general glasgow disability organisation. however they do hold events around making things. 
https://www.enable.org.uk/area/glasgow/glasgow-branch/ - charity focused on learning disabilities

### SCRIPTS
### final script for disability organisations
Dear [name],                                                              My name is Claire Williamson and I'm a 4th year computer science student at the University of Glasgow. I am doing my dissertation project on creating 'making' project tutorials that are accessible for people with disabilities, with a focus on intellectual disabilities and brain injuries. 'Making' projects combine physical objects with simple electronics and software - they can involve everything from 3D printing, electronics and prototyping boards to using cardboard. The projects aim to introduce people to new tools, exercise problem solving abilities, and teach some new knowledge of technological concepts. My dissertation project will be in the form of a website that displays the tutorials in a way that adapts to each users needs. My supervisor is Dr Stephen Lindsay (stephen.lindsay@glasgow.ac.uk).

As part of this project I'm looking to connect with local organisations who support people with these disabilities in order to get feedback on these tutorials and to improve their functionality and benefit in this space. Would this be something anyone at your organisation would be interested in? I'm happy to give more details on my project and what sort of feedback I'd be looking for. I would greatly appreciate any input you'd be willing to give to help improve my project so it can be as useful as possible. If willing we could have an online meeting to discuss this.

Many thanks, Claire Williamson

As part of this project I'm looking to connect with local makerspaces and similar organisations in order to get feedback on these tutorials and understand these spaces better. Would this be something anyone at your organisation would be interested in? I'm happy to give more details on my project and what sort of feedback I'd be looking for. I would greatly appreciate any input you'd be willing to give to help improve my project so it can be as useful as possible. If willing we could have an online meeting to discuss this.
