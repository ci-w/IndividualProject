## Projects
Discussion and notes on potential projects for the website. 

### Questions
- What tools do they usually have
- Is there an aim towards affordability? 

Majority of projects from other sites under CC licence. <br>
Balance between followable instructions and user problem solving <br>
Projects involving coding/programmable items must still be tangible. Such as write code -> immeditely see IRL <br>
As projects increase in complexity, have more coding? <br>
Editing and creating 3D print files? <br>
Use of lazer cutters? Cutting peices to be assembled as part of bigger project. Lazer cut little token like a certificate/plaque.  <br>

### Specific projects

Types of projects:
* Electronics / Circuits
* 3D printing
* Programming
* Robotics 

Electronics:
- simple circuits
- circuit tiles (interchangeable blocks)
- using a motor + low fidelity items to make a moving frog
- making a transport object (boat, car) using cardboard/foam, motor, battery pack and propellar/wheels
- electric greeting card / paper electronics

Focused on transport/cars

Robotics/programming focus. Could also create town/map/maze out of cardboard and such. Obstacles like ramps. Creating the car, or using a premade robot. Then writing a program to navigate through the maze. (from that paper)
