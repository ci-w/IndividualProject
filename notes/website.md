## Website
For notes on the website structure/design/creation process. 

* Simple form, embeddable so that people can pull to their own sites (w4 meeting)
* Shows projects based on inputted access needs and available machinery (idea)
* Feedback system built in, records the users access needs/skills and if they enjoyed the project. Then have a recommender system to recommend projects to similar people.
* Create account to store syllabus completion/skills/access requirements. Do this using plugins, fairly lightweight. 
* Having a guide on how to adapt your own projects to be more accessible
* Being able to select and do a project without it needing to be in the syllabus

Modes
* simpler language option
* many pictures/diagrams
* "extra help" button?
