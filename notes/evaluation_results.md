# Participant 1 
Pre-study interview:
Experience of makerspaces: was in the makerspace club in high school. (i have more info on this) 
Didn't use any tutorial sites, mainly youtube videos. 
Experience of disability: dyslexic :) 

Points made: clarify WHAT my tool is - is it an online makerspace or is it physical i.e. you physically have the tools and use the website. 
- need to add those explanations in for "skill levels" i.e. what does it mean by vision 
- potentially have a drop down for tool levels
- dont just have raw numbers for tool levels (confusing)
- agreed that the button for completing project was a good idea (i.e. would increment user profile)
- said it seems important to have settings you can change to navigate the site better (I.e. my "site requirements")
- lines of text were too close together (not fixed by zoom)
- believed the site would lower the barriers (knowledge gap), particularly with the syllabus: "if you're on your own and you know you want to achieve something but you're not sure how to get there, it will show you the intermediate steps."
- simplify instructions further
- seems very easy to use, intuitive once I add those explanations 
- again, not just having raw numbers (or really numbers at all)
- worried about there being too much text and it being overwhelming. (on the project pages) (and in general, seeing a lot of text and shutting down)
- ^ i suggested the "difficulty" bar instead of showing the full stats for each project (in relation to the users profile), said it seemed like a good idea. 
- also option of having images instead of skill levels (like 1 star, 2 stars)


Things she'd like:
- show somewhere which/how many projects you have completed (not just from the syllabus, but overall)
- (assuming its one instructor with a group of students - itll be in the same room hence have the same tools) so have some way of putting in what tools are avaliable in advance/to everyone at once. 
- ^ also the issue of people not knowing/its hard to tell what skill level you are at, so an instructor doing that 
- section on safety/how to use these tools safely 
- in the vein of having too much text, an option to have images instead of text (toggle) i.e. instead of a list of words for materials, pictures of each material. (they would find that more helpful) and images for each step
