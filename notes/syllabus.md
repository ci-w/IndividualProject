## Syllabus
Notes on how the syllabus for the site could work. <br>

Number of cirriculum options avaliable: probably not many, around 3-4. <br>
Idea of being able to choose from a list of suitable projects to fufill a syllabus requirement. <br>
Syllabuses and projects that combine various skills are a good idea. <br>

Potential workflow <br>
1.) Learn how circuits work
* Putting premade blocks together
* Adding additional components
* Creating own blocks from scratch
* Creating a final personalised item like the furry creature from tapeblocks paper

2.) Learn how 3D printers work
* Making a small simple game token
* Provided 3D print file, perhaps different options?
* No assembly needed of parts
* Learning how to load up the file and print material
* How to start the printer etc

3.) Final project combining circuits and a 3D printed model
* Something like a 3D printed shell with eye holes for LEDs that you could put a circuit block inside
* Not too fiddly
