## Diss questions for next supervisor meeting
- where abouts should i specify that this project focuses on people with IDs/cognitive impairments 
- where should i put in that I wasnt able to speak to these people (ethics approval) (i.e. in relation to cooperative design)
- where should i put that i reached out to local makerspaces/id orgs but they didnt respond in time for interviews 
- where should i put discussion of "framing" i.e. what situation this tool is aimed at
- what am I meant to do with the signed evaluation forms 
- can i refer to "the tool" as "Making Projects" (without "" or with) throughout the diss? 
- should i really be calling it "dynamic" making projects because they are very much. static
- should i be talking about the refactor in the design or implementation section as it kinda covers both. maybe just put relevant parts in relevant sections. 
- use of the language "tangible learning" and "making". what should i try to use. 



Having the same project be adaptable so that users with different access requirements can complete it. I.e. having steps be carried out in a different way. Idea of the final way being someone else helping the user as you want to promote independence. 

(relevant notes: Assumption about where these projects are to be carried out. Many areas:
* specialised disability group with coaches
* traditional makerspace and this then goes to who is present: disability coach, a technical expert, a carer learning alongside them, researcher-led? All of these require different framing of instructions/projects etc. Potentially able to cover a few areas but need to research into how these differ. Supervisor said to go for researcher-led.)
