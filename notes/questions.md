## Diss questions for next supervisor meeting
- where abouts should i specify that this project focuses on people with IDs/cognitive impairments 
- where should i put in that I wasnt able to speak to these people (ethics approval) (i.e. in relation to cooperative design)
- where should i put that i reached out to local makerspaces/id orgs but they didnt respond in time for interviews 
- where should i put discussion of "framing" i.e. what situation this tool is aimed at
(relevant notes: Assumption about where these projects are to be carried out. Many areas:
* specialised disability group with coaches
* traditional makerspace

and this then goes to who is present: disability coach, a technical expert, a carer learning alongside them, researcher-led? All of these require different framing of instructions/projects etc. Potentially able to cover a few areas but need to research into how these differ. Supervisor said to go for researcher-led.)


Majority of projects from other sites under CC licence. <br>
Balance between followable instructions and user problem solving <br>
Projects involving coding/programmable items must still be tangible. Such as write code -> immeditely see IRL <br>
As projects increase in complexity, have more coding? <br>
Editing and creating 3D print files? <br>
Use of lazer cutters? Cutting peices to be assembled as part of bigger project. Lazer cut little token like a certificate/plaque.  <br>



Originally had the idea of only having 3-4 set syllabuses, but changed it to be fully customisable. :) 


Having the same project be adaptable so that users with different access requirements can complete it. I.e. having steps be carried out in a different way. Idea of the final way being someone else helping the user as you want to promote independence. 

This is connected to how to handle the user specifying their ability/access needs for projects in an accurate and inoffensive way. This would be used to tailor the syllabus/steps in projects. Perhaps as a test of their skills.

Concept of "gamifying" the acquisition of skills. For example, tokens (like a certificate for completing a project) that are created using the technology utilised in the project. A small lapel pin made by a 3D printer, or for an electronics project, one that lights up.
