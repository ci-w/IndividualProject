### Ethics
"7.	No participant has an impairment that may limit their understanding or communication" <br>
Would not be able to interview people with LD/brain injury without extra ethics approval. <br>
"More unusual projects (e.g. participants under the age of 16, or with an impairment) will require that your supervisor make a full ethics application to the College Ethics Committee" <br>
Instead could speak to people involved with people with ID/BI instead, about those peoples experiences. Is it worth doing this, or going through the ethics process?
